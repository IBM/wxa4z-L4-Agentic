# Overview of Agent Deployment

IBM watsonx Assistant for Z delivers the next level of productivity with Agentic AI, providing one place to build, manage and run all your agents. Agents are designed to understand user intent, collaborate, and provide comprehensive responses.


With watsonx Assistant for Z, users have available a set of pre-built Z domain-specific agents that cover two categories:

- **Foundational Agents** - enabled by default and covered by the IBM watsonx Assistant for Z entitlement

- **Prebuilt IBM Z Product Agents** - require separate product entitlements (e.g. Db2 for z/OS agent, IntelliMagic Agent for Z)

## Foundational Agents

**Foundational agents** work together to collect all required information by leveraging integrated tools, and then provide a detailed and comprehensive answer to any query, enabling more informed decision making with limited human intervention.

These agents are enabled by default and are available upon installing watsonx Assistant for Z. 

Below is a summary of the foundational agents that are available with the product:

**Agent** | **Description**
--- | --- 
**IBM Z Support Agent** | The Support Agent enables users to run Ansible playbooks through Ansible Automation Platform, triggered by user input. Supported playbooks include: collecting z/OS dumps from a specified z/OS address space, and transfering a dump to IBM Support. Additionally, the agent provides functionality to retrieve the status of initiated Ansible jobs and access job logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.    
**IBM Z OMEGAMON Insights Agent** | The IBM Z OMEGAMON Insights Agent allows system programmers to access and analyze system data directly through the watsonx Assistant for Z chat interface. By leveraging OMEGAMON data, it delivers accurate insights that help streamline system monitoring and decision-making.
**IBM Z Upgrade Agent** | The IBM Z Upgrade Agent enables system programmers to perform z/OS upgrades through the watsonx Assistant for Z chat interface. It provies precise responses by leveraging z/OSMF APIs and client-specific documentation stored in the zRAG.
**IBM Z Automation Insights Agent** | The Automation Insights Agent allows system programmers to retrieve and analyze system data through the watsonx Assistant for Z chat interface. It delivers accurate insights by leveraging data from the Automation and NetView domains, helping users better understand system behavior and performance.
**IBM Z Workload Scheduler Insights Agent** | The Workload Schduler Insights Agent enables system programmers to access and analyze workload and engine-relatd information through the watsonx Assistant for Z chat interface. It helps users gain visibility into scheduling operations and system activity, supporting more informed decision-making and faster issue resolution.


## Prebuilt IBM Z Product Agents

The Prebuilt IBM Z Product Agents across various IBM Z software solutions simplify complex tasks and enhance productivity through natural language interactions. Together, these agents streamline operations, deliver actionable insights, and make mainframe technologies more accessible and user-friendly.

These agents require separate product entitlements in order to deploy and run on the watsonx Assistant for Z platform, and can be enabled as needed, according to each agentâ€™s specific requirements.
