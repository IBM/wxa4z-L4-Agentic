# Setup VS Code workspace with the **wxa4z-agent-suite** Helm Charts

In this section you will setup your VS Code workspace with the *IBM watsonx Assistant for Z - Agent Suite* Helm Charts that you will later deploy onto your cluster. The helm chart deploys multiple z/OS agents with a single command, using shared configuration and per-agent overrides. In the following section you will see how the **Agent suite** works.

1. The very first step in configuring the **Agent Suite** is to firstly download the **wxa4z-agent-suite** .zip file to your local workstation, which contains the Agent Suite Helm Charts.

    Navigate to the below link and download the provided .zip file from Box to your local workstation:

2. After downloading the .zip file, unzip or extract the file to your local workstation.

3. Once extracted, open up a new VS Code session (if not already open), and open your extracted ***wxa4z-agent-suite*** folder on your local workstation.
   
    * If opening a new VS code window, this can be done by clicking **Open Folder**
