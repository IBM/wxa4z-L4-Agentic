# Configuring Shared (Global) Agent variables

Within your `values.yaml` file of the ***wxa4z-agent-suite*** folder, the first section of the file references `global` variables that get set first and are used by each of the agents.

After the global variables there are sections for each of the agents with agent-specific variables that must be set. In this section you will configure the global variables section of your `values.yaml` file.

**ACTION:** Within your VS Code window, click on the `values.yaml` file to open up the contents within VS Code.
