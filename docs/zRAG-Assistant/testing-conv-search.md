# Testing conversational search with zRAG connection

Now you can begin issuing queries to test the assistantâ€™s responses. For more detailed responses, try appending `Please provide a detailed response` to the end of your question.

**Important:** Modify settings iteratively based on your assessment of response quality. Review and change them at any time. For example, add extra prompt instructions, change response verbosity, and modify OpenSearch indexes.

1. Hover your cursor over the left-side navigation and click **Preview**.

*You have now created and deployed your own assistant with conversational search capabilities, and your client can understand how watsonx Assistant for Z provides its content-grounded responses to any Z-related questions. This was done by configuring your assistant to use the zRAG that has over 220 knowledge sources, and uses this knowledge to provide AI-generated responses.*

*In the following section, you will demonstrate how clients can personalize their assistant with an internal knowledge base that contains documentation they add to the RAG. This will provide a level of context- awareness of their own internal processes and procedures when company-specific questions are asked to the assistant.*
