# Test the **IBM Z Support Agent**

Now you will test the capabilities of the **IBM Z Support Agent**.

1. Within the **Agent Builder** view, click on the tile for your **IBM Z Support Agent**.

2. Once in the agent editor view for the IBM Z Support Agent, take note of the following agent definitions which were bootstrapped as part of the watsonx Assistant for Z deployment:

    - Orchestrator agent description
    - Collaborator agent (pointing to your deployed external agent on OpenShift)
    - Orchestrator agent instructions/behavior

3. On the right-hand side of the screen, you should see **Preview** chat window for your agent. Click in the text-box of the **Preview** chat window and prompt the agent with the following, replacing **`<dump title>`** with a unique name for your dump:
   
    `Take z/OS dump with dump title <dump title>`

    **IMAGE**

4. Youâ€™ll then get a response from the agent prompting you for more details. Respond with the following information:
   
    * **storage areas** (optional): provide a list of storage areas to include in the dump, or exclude to use the default
    * **jobname:** provide a unique job name for running the job on z/OS
    * **dataset name:** provide a unique dataset name used to capture the dump
        * ensure your dataset name follows standard dataset naming conventions and rules on z/OS
    * **verbosity** (optional): provide a verbosity level to use, or exclude to use the default

    *For example:*

    ```
    use jobname *MASTER* and dataset name IBMUSER.TEST.DUMP9
    ```

    **IMAGE**

5. Based on the inputs provided, the agent may request for more details in order to run the job. If provided enough details, the agent will then provide a summary of the parameters supplied and ask to approve or reject.

    Respond with `approve`

    **IMAGE**

6. After approving the job, the agent will return a response, including the **job_id** and **job_status**. This initiates a run of the corresponding Ansible playbook in AAP to capture a z/OS system dump.

7. You can next check the status of the job by prompting the agent with the following, replacing `<job_id>` with the job id returned by your agent.
   
    `Check status of job <job_id>`

    *For example:*

    **IMAGE**

8. In the above example, the job status is `successful`. As a next step, you could initiate the transmitting of the z/OS dump to IBM support via a case number. For example, this can be done with the following prompt:
   
    `Send z/OS dump from dataset <dataset-name> to case number TS019840250`

    **NOTE:** For this tool execution, you can use case # **TS019840250**.


9. After prompting the agent, it will then provide a summary asking you to approve or reject, as shown below:
    
    **IMAGE**

10. Once approved, the agent will return a summary, including the **job_id** and **job_status** as shown below:
    
    **IMAGE**

11. Like before, you can check the status by prompting the agent with the following, replacing `<job_id>` with the job id returned by your agent:
    
    `Check status of job <job_id>`
    
    **IMAGE**

    **NOTE:** you can continue monitoring the status of the job with the above command until the agent returns that the job was successful.
