# Create Deployment Space

The next step in your watsonx.ai configuration is creating a new **Deployment space**. Your ***Deployment Space ID*** is another secret that will be referenced later on in the configuration of your agents deployment.

1. Click on the 'hamburger' menu icon in the top-left corner of the screen and click on **Deployment spaces**.

    - **Name:** enter a unique name for the deployment space
    - **Storage:** ensure your COS instance is selected
    - **Watsonx.ai Runtime (optional):** ensure your existing service is selected
  
    Then click **Create**.

6. Finally, in the **General** tab, locate your **Space GUID**. This is your ***Deployment Space ID*** that will be frequently referenced in your agents configuration. 
   
    *Copy and record your **‘Space GUID’** value in a local notepad for later use*.

    ***IMPORTANT: copy and record your ‘Space GUID’ value in a local notepad for later use - and label it as your ‘Deployment Space ID’***.
